- use clang to extract the AST, something like: clang -Xclang -ast-dump -fsyntax-only js.c
- Currently, due to high I/O (reading files multiple times), loading of data is very slow. By using pandas dataframe, we can read coverage files only once. DONE
- Document how to run the scripts.
- check for differences in the distribution of coverage between generated test cases and the seed test cases.
